Two designs.

1. Acrylic, made from cut sheets of acrylic. 

Pros: Quicker to build, looks more professional, transparent.

Cons: Expensive.

2. Printed, made from a large number of 3d printed plates and bolted together. 

Pros: Inexpensive, looks interesting, easier to customize (shelf for camera, etc), disassembles easily and compactly. 

Cons: Time consuming. 

The printed version has the ability to generate a model for rendering, as well as the ability to generate STLs for printing.
User configured params are located in "enclosure.yaml".

Requires python and PyYAML. In Debian you can install PyYAML with: apt-get install python-yaml.
