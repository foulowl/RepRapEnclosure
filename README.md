Two designs.

1. Acrylic, made from cut sheets of acrylic. 
Pros: Quicker to build, looks more professional, transparent.
Cons: Expensive.
2. Printed, made from a large number of 3d printed plates and bolted together. 
Pros: Inexpensive, looks interesting, easier to customize (shelf for camera, etc), disassembles easily and compactly. 
Cons: Time consuming.
